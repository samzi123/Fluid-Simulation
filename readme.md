# Fluid Simulation
This is a 2D fluid simulation based on the [Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) method, implemented in Rust and the Bevy game engine, which was a lot of fun to work with.

The simulation is based on the paper [Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf) by Matthias MÃ¼ller, David Charypar, and Markus Gross. [Sebastian Lague's fluid simulation series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE) on YouTube was a great resource for understanding the basics of fluid simulation and SPH.
